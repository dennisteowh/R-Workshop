
# Exercise: Use R to get the answers to the questions below (Don't just type the answer...)
#           You are encouraged to try different methods to get the (hopefully same) answer
#           By the end, you should be able to see why some methods are superior to others

# Rules: You can only use functions that are within the "Allowable Functions List.pdf"

animals <- c("Mufasa", "Simba", "Timon", "Pumbaa", "Nala")
weight <- c(40, 20, 3, 1000, 19)
species <- c("lion", "lion", "meerket", "warthog", "lion")

# 1) Which animals weigh less than 20kg?


# 2) How many animals weigh less than 20kg?


# 3) Does Mufasa weigh less than 20kg?


# 4) Which lions weigh more than or equal to 20kg?


# 5) Sort the animals in alphabetical order (just print the answer out, no need to modify the original animals vector)


# 6) Sort the animals according to their weight (in descending order; just print the answer out, no need to modify the original animals vector)


# 7) What is the last animal (ordered alphabetically)?


# 8) Does the last animal (ordered alphabetically) weigh exactly 3 kg?


# 9) Add another animal called "Zazu" to the animals vector and 
#    add another weight of 1.2 (corresponding to Zazu's weight) to the weight vector 
#    add another species of "hornbill" (corresponding to Zazu's species) to the species vector


# 10) Rerun your code from the previous questions. Do they still give the correct answers?
