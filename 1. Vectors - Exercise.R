#           You are encouraged to try different methods to get the (hopefully same) answer
#           By the end, you should be able to see why some methods are superior to others

# Rules: You can only use functions that are within the "Allowable Functions List.pdf"

animals <- c("Mufasa", "Simba", "Timon", "Pumbaa", "Nala")
weight <- c(40, 20, 3, 1000, 19)

# 1) Which animals weigh less than 20kg?


# 2) How many animals weigh less than 20kg?


# 3) Does Mufasa weigh less than 20kg?


# 4) Sort the animals in your vectors in alphabetical order


# 5) What is the last animal (ordered alphabetically)?


# 6) Does the last animal (ordered alphabetically) weigh exactly 3 kg?


# 7) Add another animal called "Zazu" to the animals vector and 
#    add another weight of 1.2 (corresponding to Zazu's weight) to the weight vector 


# 8) Rerun your code from the previous questions. Do they still give the correct answers?
