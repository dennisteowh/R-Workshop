# Basic For Loop (initialize then iterate)



# What is i? 



# Iterate over what?



# Loops + Conditional Statements (colored sheep example)

set.seed(100)

sheep_herd <- sample(c("white sheep", "black sheep", "bald sheep", "horse"), 100, replace = T)

## Summing Even Numbers example (for practice)

some_numbers <- 34:103

# rep() for initialization


# Break and Next


# nested loops (we will see this more when covering Dataframes)
