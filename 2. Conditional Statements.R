## To be a responsible and sustainable fisherman, one ought to follow some basic fishing guidelines:
## a) Endangered species should be returned immediately to the Ocean
## b) You can take a fish home if it is at least 183 cm in length

## Write a conditional statement to capture the rules of these guidelines. 
## Given a fish (and knowing whether it's endangered or not, as well as its length), 
## Output a decision of whether the fish should be "Return to Sea" or "Put in my Belly"
